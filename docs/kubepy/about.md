# KubePY

### What is KubePY?
KubePY is a Python module for writing KubeJS scripts in Python instead of having to write them in JavaScript. It is currently in its very early days and lacks support for advanced features. Expect some things to be broken or not to work at all.

#### Current Features
- <a href="/docs/kubepy/custom_recipes">Custom Recipe Creation</a>
- <a href="/docs/kubepy/custom_items">Custom Item Creation</a>
- <a href="/docs/kubepy/custom_blocks">Custom Block Creation</a>
